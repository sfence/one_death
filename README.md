Introduction
------------
This mod allows only one death.

Based on configuration, the world will be destroyed after death or  
the player will lose privileges to interact with the world and others.
See settingtypes.txt for details.

For single-player worlds, the world is destroyed as default.
For multi-player worlds, players lost privileges by default.

If the player is an admin and cannot lose privileges, he is kicked after death.
